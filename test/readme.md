OpenTable front-end task
========================

Thanks for taking the time to complete our front-end test.  We hope you find it straighforward and not too time consuming - it is representative of the work the front-end team is currently undertaking at toptable and OpenTable.

Please ask any questions and submit your test to John Catterfeld (Senior Front-End Developer) at [jcatterfeld@opentable.com][mailto] or tweet [@jcatterfeld][tweet].

## The task

We are rebuilding our existing [Search Results][livesearchresults] for toptable.co.uk.  This test will focus on specific elements within the page, so the test submission should be part-wireframe and part-finalised code.

The page should meet the following acceptance criteria.

### Search Page
- Page visually looks like the supplied wireframe ([search-results-wireframe1.png][screenshot1])
- When I click Find a table, [a call is made to our sample API][api] that returns restaurants with timeslots (see [search-results-wireframe2.png][screenshot2])
- This call simulates a search for any date at 19:30, so the actual form elements do not need to function.

The wireframe serves as a guideline for how the page should be laid out and we're not looking for pixel perfection. Feel free to make any design improvements that you can justify when we meet you!
