OpenTable front-end task
========================

Thanks for taking the time to complete our front-end test, we hope you find it straighforward.  Please aim to spend one to two hours on this work.

Please ask any questions and submit your test to John Catterfeld (Senior Front-End Developer) at [jcatterfeld@opentable.com][mailto] or tweet [@jcatterfeld][tweet].

## The task

We would like to build a simple menu application in JavaScript from which you can choose a meal for two from the supplied menu, select the tip to leave, and are shown the total cost.  Please include tests around your JavaScript.

## Menu rules

This restaurant unfortunately has a number of rules about the meals that can be ordered.

- Each person must have at least two courses, one of which must be a main
- Each diner cannot have more than one of the same course
- The two diners cannot have identical meals
- There is only one piece of cheesecake left
- Pierre the snobby waiter will not let you have Prawn cocktail and Salmon fillet in the same meal


## Acceptance criteria

- The total amount of the bill is displayed when dishes have been selected
- A dropdown of tip amounts is displayed, from which I can select 0%, 10%, 12.5%, 15% or 20%.
- The tip drodown defaults to 12.5%
