A simple guide to getting started with Git

### Cloning a repository

Cloning means copying all files from a remote repository to the current location on your local machine. The simpliest form of cloning is:

```
git clone https://github.com/user/example
```

This copies all files to a new folder called 'example'. You can assign a different name to the folder by using:

```
git clone https://github.com/user/example folder
```

### Forking a repository

Forking a repository is similar to cloning, but instead of giving you access to push to  :

```
git clone https://github.com/user/example
```

This copies all files to a new folder called 'example'. You can assign a different name to the folder by using:

```
git clone https://github.com/user/example folder
```
