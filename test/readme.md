Thanks for taking the time to complete our front-end test, we hope you find it straighforward.  Please aim to spend one to two hours on this work.

Please ask any questions and submit your test to John Catterfeld (Senior Front-End Developer) at [jcatterfeld@opentable.com][mailto] or tweet [@jcatterfeld][tweet].

## Menu rules

This restaurant unfortunately has a number of rules about the meals that can be ordered.

- Each person must have at least two courses, one of which must be a main.
- Each diner cannot have more than one of the same course.
- The two diners cannot have identical meals.
- There is only one piece of cheesecake left.
- Pierre the snobby waiter will not let you have prawn cocktail and salmon fillet in the same meal.


## Acceptance criteria

- The total amount of the bill is displayed when dishes have been selected.
- An error message is displayed when I try to select an invalid menu combination.
